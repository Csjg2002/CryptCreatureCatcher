<h2>Description</h2>
Catch fantasical creatures that lurk deep within an ancient crypt, all while battling through hordes of mischevious goblins and the darkest of undead knights!

CRYPT CREATURE CATCHER is a hybrid of a dungeon crawler and a creature collector game. The goal is explore the crypt and catch 'em all!

Created for the the LowRezJam 2024!

I was the solo programmer for this project. This project was my first experience using Git and also working with WebGL builds
